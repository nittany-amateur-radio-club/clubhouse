# Use

- Confirm that it is impossible for your transceiver to transmit while you are connecting your transceiver's (color-tagged) feedline to one of the antenna connectors.
- Switch antennas manually by connecting your radio feedline from array of antenna connectors on the north wall.
- When you leave the shack, disconnect the transceiver feedline from the antenna you were using.
