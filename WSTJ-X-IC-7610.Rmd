### WSTJ-X on IC-7610

#### On the PC

1. Open WSTJ-X. (Icon is on desktop.)

**Note**: If you will be using the rig regularly, you may wish to clone an existing Configuration set and edit it for your particular use. 
From the Configurations menu, choose a source Configuration, e.g., Standard Ops, select “Clone”, then from the Configurations menu, choose the clone, and switch to it by selecting the “Switch To” menu item. 
When WSTJ-X reopens with the new Configurations set, open Settings from File/Settings menu and confirm the settings.

2. Confirm Settings

It’s not essential to confirm the settings each time you start up, but doing so will make sure that you are able to operate without difficulty.

*General tab:*

Set my Call to your personal callsign unless you have permission to use the club callsign (W3YA). 
Set any Display or Behavior settings per your personal preferences.

*Radio tab:*

Rig: Icom IC-7610</br>
CAT Control: COM3</br>
Baud Rate: 19200</br>
8 bits, 1 stop bit, none</br>

Force Control Lines: unset

PTT method: CAT (port should be COM3)</br>
Mode: Data/pkt</br>
Split operation: Rig or Fake It</br>

You may want to check/confirm that rig control is working by pushing the button in this panel. 
You may also want to check that PTT is working by pressing the PTT button. 
Make sure you have adjusted the rig’s power output to a low level (1-5 W) before testing.

*Audio tab:*

Input: USB Audio Codec
Output: USB Audio Codec

*Advanced tab:*

Check or uncheck Special Operating Activity per situation, for example ARRL Field Day or the NA VHF Contest.

You may now close the Settings window.

Switch to the desired mode (e.g., FT8) from the Mode menu.
Select the desired operating band and default frequency from the dropdown menu on the lower left side of the main WSJT-X application panel.

3. Check computer clock accuracy

Open a browser; visit https://time.is

If your time synch is within .5s of the correct time, you may proceed.

If you have a cellular hotspot, you may wish to connect it to the hub. 
Power the hub, wait for the computers to establish an internet connection, and allow the Meinberg time server application to update the time.

If you are decoding signals, then all is well.

#### On the IC-7610

1. Confirm rig is in USB Data 2 (USB-D2) mode.

To change the mode, press the mode indicator on the touch screen to open a window to toggle the mode (USB/LSB). 
Press and hold the DATA button to switch between D1, D2, and D3 data mode connectors. 
D2 is configured for use via USB.

Set your bandwidth to filter 1 (wide).

You may adjust the filter settings by pressing the filter button on the right side of the rig control panel.

2. Check audio output levels

Turn AGC off; NR and NB off; Preamp off.

3. Set desired power output using MULTI knob.

Remember, WSJT-X is a weak signal mode. Less than 50 W is plenty. 

#### On KPA1500

1. For < 100W output, set amplifier to STBY mode (yellow light) by pressing MODE button to toggle between STBY and OPER. 

For higher power output, follow separate instructions for tuning the KPA1500 amplifier.

2. Confirm ANT1 is output (press ANTENNA to toggle).

3. Confirm ATU is IN (not BYP) by pressing and holding ATU TUNE button. 

Have fun!
