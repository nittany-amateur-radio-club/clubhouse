The radio station is one of the best benefits of joining the club.\nRick Gilmore, W3TM manages the station with the help of Mike Coslo N3LI, Eric Prescott W3EDP, and Woody Brem K3YV. Mark Wharton K0LO provides computer networking support.\nThis site provides information about how to gain access to the mountaintop station and how to use the equipment.\nThe mountaintop station has been a focal point of activity for the club. We operated Field Day 2023 from the station, and we have held W3M special event operations, Pennsylvania QSO Party activities, and other contesting events."

    "text": "Arrival procedures\nHere is the sequence we prefer all members use when accessing the mountaintop station.\n\nUnlock the yellow gate. Use the small key to unlock the padlock. The larger key opens the clubhouse itself. Take the padlock and locking bolt with you to the shack.\nClose the gate and replace the lock bar, but do not re-lock the gate.\nIf you know that others will be joining you soon, you may leave the gate open, but make sure to park cross-wise, blocking the past the shack. This ensures that no other driver can inadvertently drive past you and get locked behind the gate when you leave.\n\n\n\n\nNARC Clubhouse looking North\n\n\n\nUnlock door of the shack using the larger of the two keys. There is one lock above the door handle. Turn the key to the left (counterclockwise) to unlock the door.\nThere are light switches on the left just inside the door.\nPut the padlock and locking bar on the desk near the door.\nTurn up the heat, if needed.\n\nGo to the breaker box near the southeast corner of the shack (on your right as you enter the shack). By default, we leave breakers 7-14 – the baseboard and north wall 240 V heaters – off, and the remainder on. There is a label on the breaker panel to remind you.\nTurn breakers 7-14 on by pushing the breaker lever to the left to align with the others.\n\nThe porta potty key is on a hook to the right of the door. Note: The small key that opens the State Forest gate also opens the porta potty.\n\nThe toilet is serviced periodically. If it needs to be serviced, please let Rick W3TM know. The porta potty is on the South side of the shack.\n\nPlease text W3TM K3ROG (814-777-3298), Eric W3EDP (814-867-3393), or Mike N3LI (814-404-3991) when you leave. Please report any issues that need to be addressed."
