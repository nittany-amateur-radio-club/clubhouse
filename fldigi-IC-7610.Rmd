### fldigi on IC-7610/NARC1

As of 2019-10-20, the installed version is 4.1.03.

#### On the PC

1. Open fldigi. (Icon is on desktop.)

Fldigi is configured to use the flrig program to interface between the radio and the computer. 
Flrig should open automatically a few seconds after fldigi opens. 
If flrig shows the current VFO frequency and so does fldigi, the two devices are talking to one another.

2. Confirm Settings

Itâ€™s not essential to confirm the settings each time you start up, but doing so will make sure that you are able to operate without difficulty.

- In flrig, open the Config menu and select Setup > Transceiver.
This opens a separate window.

Rig: IC-7610</br>
Ser Port: COM3</br>
Baud: 19200</br>
(Stop bits:) 1</br>
PTT via CAT checked</br>

CV-V adr:0x98 </br>

You may now close the Configuration window by pressing the CLOSE button or close window (X) button.

3. Check receive operations

- Turn to a known PSK31 frequency, for example, 14070.
- From the Op Mode menu, select PSK > BPSK-31

If all is well, you should see decodes in the left hand window and signals in the waterfall below.

4. Configure your operational settings.

- From the Configure menu, select UI > Operator to open a window.
- Under the Operator tab set Station Callsign, Operator Callsign, Operator Name, Antenna, Station QTH, Station Locator and other items.
