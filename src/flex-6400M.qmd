## Flex 6400M HF Transceiver

![](include/img/flex-6400M.jpg)

This transceiver is currently connected to the NARC-2 computer.

### Connect equipment and power-up

::: {.callout-note}

We have been experimenting with remote control of some station operations, including powering on the rig power supplies.
As a result, the next set of actions may or may not be required.

:::

1. Connect to the power mains.
    - Power cables are located between the wooden shelf and the east wall.
    - Plug the large 240 V cable (green tag) for the amplifier power supply into the 240 V wall outlet.
    - Plug the smaller 120 V cable for the Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) into the 120 V wall outlet.

2. Connect the radio to a suitable antenna.

**Before you power up the radio, connect it to a suitable antenna**.
**The antenna connections are located on the north wall, near the repeater cabinet**.
Choose the PL-259 connector with the <span color="yellow">yellow</span> FlexRadio tag.
Plug the cable from the radio into the cable connector for one of the antennas, for example, one of the triband Yagis for 10-20 m.
**Please do not remove the N/PL-259 connectors from the antenna feedlines.**
    
3. Power up the UPS by pushing the front button. The green power light should illuminate.

Check to see if the Astron RS-35A power supply is on before carrying out the next step.

4. Power up the Astron RS-35A power supply that powers the IC-7610/NARC1. The power supply is located to the right of the Elecraft KPA1500 amplifier.

5. Power up the Flex/NARC-2 by pressing and briefly holding the power button.

If you do not plan to use the amplifier or the built-in antenna tuner, you may skip step 6.

6. Power up the Elecraft KPA1500 amplifier

The Flex/NARC-2 is connected to the Elecraft KPA1500 amplifier. 
The power supply for the KPA1500 is under the desk on a small footstool. 
Check that the KPA1500 power supply is on. 
If necessary, power-up the power supply by hitting the power switch on the upper rear left side of the power supply. When the amplifier power switch is on, you will see 3 green lights: AC on, High V supply, Low V supply.
Power up the KPA1500 by pressing the `on` switch on the lower right hand side of the KPA1500 front panel.

#### Log-in to the computer

1. Power up the PC by pressing the power button on the right rear of the computer/display.

2. Log-in using the appropriate password.

The Flex 6400 is connected via USB to the NARC-2 PC.

Open your logging program of choice. NARC has licenses for N1MM and N3FJP's Amateur Contact Log.

To operate digital modes (e.g., FT8/FT4, JS8Call, fldigi), open those programs. 
See instructions for operating these modes in separate documents.

### Basic controls

- Audio levels for the two VFOs are controlled via separate knobs on the left side of the front panel.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/ic-7610-af.png")
```

- You may switch operating bands in one of two ways:
    - Buttons located on the right side of the front panel
    - Pressing the frequency on the touch screen.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/ic-7610-chg-band.png")
```

- Switch operating modes by pressing the mode button on the touch panel. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/ic-7610-chg-mode.png")
```

This opens a window where you can choose the mode of operation.
    - Hit the arrow button to close the window and save your choice.
    
- Turn digital noise reduction on or off by pressing the NR button on the left side of the front panel. 
When NR is on, the NR button will be illuminated.
    - To adjust the amount of noise reduction, press and hold the NR button to open a window on the upper right corner of the touch panel display.
    - Turn the MULTI key to adjust the level of noise reduction.
    - Close the NR window by pressing the MULTI key or by pressing the NR button.
- Adjust preamplifier (`P.AMP`) settings, automatic gain control (`AGC`), Intercept Point (`IP+`), `VOX`, and compression (`COMP`) settings by pressing the corresponding button on the left side of the touch/display screen.

```{r}

```

- Adjust touch/display screen settings via the MENU1/MENU2 buttons at the bottom of the touch/display screen.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/ic-7610-menu-touch-buttons.png")
```

- Select receive filter settings via the `FILTER` button on the right side of the front panel, below the `TWIN PBT` knob.

```{r}
