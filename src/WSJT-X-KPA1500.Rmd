1. For < 100W output, set amplifier to STBY mode (yellow light) by pressing the MODE button to toggle between STBY (yellow light) and OPER (green).

For higher power output, follow separate instructions for [tuning the KPA1500 amplifier](KPA1500-tuning.html).

2. Confirm ANT1 is output (press ANTENNA to toggle).
