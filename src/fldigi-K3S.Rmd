### fldigi on the K3S/NARC2

As of 2019-10-20, the installed version is 4.1.03.

#### On the PC

1. Open fldigi. (Icon is on desktop.)

Fldigi is configured to use the flrig program to interface between the radio and the computer. 
Flrig should open automatically a few seconds after fldigi opens. 
If flrig shows the current VFO frequency and so does fldigi, the two devices are talking to one another.

2. Confirm Settings

It’s not essential to confirm the settings each time you start up, but doing so will make sure that you are able to operate without difficulty.

- In flrig, open the Config menu and select Setup > Transceiver.
This opens a separate window.

Rig: K3</br>
Ser Port: COM3</br>
Baud: 19200</br>
(Stop bits:) 1</br>
PTT via CAT checked</br>

You may now close the Configuration window by pressing the CLOSE button or close window (X) button.

3. Check receive operations

- Turn to a known PSK31 frequency, for example, 14070.
- From the Op Mode menu, select PSK > BPSK-31

If all is well, you should see decodes in the left hand window and signals in the waterfall below.

4. Configure your operational settings.

- From the Configure menu, select UI > Operator to open a window.
- Under the Operator tab set Station Callsign, Operator Callsign, Operator Name, Antenna, Station QTH, Station Locator and other items.

#### On the K3S

1. Confirm rig is in Data A mode 

- (if necessary, hit MODE button on right side of front panel to cycle to DATA mode; indicator will be near Tx icon on right side of the display).

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/elecraft-k3s-mode.png")
```

Press (and hold) the DATA MD (AFX) button on the middle right of the panel.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/elecraft-k3s-data-mode.png")
```

Using the VFO B knob, select DATA A (not AFSK A).
Press DATA MD again to enter change.

2. Set bandwidth to maximum (4 kHz) by rotating WIDTH knob (above and to the left of the VFO A knob) clockwise until the screen shows a 4.0 bandwidth.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/elecraft-k3s-bandwidth.png")
```

3. Press SPEED/MIC button to MIC. When LINE appears, set level to 30 (midrange).

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/elecraft-k3s-speed-mic.png")
```

4. Set ALC. 

From within WSTJ-X, hit Tune button; adjust audio level from computer “speaker” slider and WSTJ-X Power slider until ALC meter reads about 4 bars. Then adjust K3S mic gain to produce 4 bars solid with the 5th bar flickering.

Adjust transmit power via Power knob on K3S.
Remember, WSJT-X is a weak signal mode. 
Less than 50 W is plenty.

#### On KPA1500

<!-- Elecraft KPA1500 -->
```{r, child = 'WSJT-X-KPA1500.Rmd'}
```
