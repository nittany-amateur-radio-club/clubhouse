The mountaintop station has many antennas from which to choose.
This page describes them.

## Towers

With the help of K3ARL's team from Centre Communications, the club maintains four towers.

### 60 foot tower

- 4 element Mosley triband (10, 15, 20m + WARC bands - 12 and 17m) Yagi
- 40m dipole

### 100 foot tower

- VHF 4 element vertical orientation Yagi + rotator
- 2 VHF fixed direction vertical orientation 6 element Yagis (W3YA system)
- VHF 2m vertical polarization
- 20m dipole

### 80 foot tower

- 4 element triband (10, 15, 20m + WARC) Yagi
  - Rotor
- ~~160m dipole~~
- 40m dipole

## Antennas by band

### 10, 12, 15, 17, 20m

- 4 element triband (10, 15, 20m + WARC bands - 12 and 17m) Yagi (on 60 foot tower)
    - Yaesu rotator (new in 2023)
    - Green Heron rotator controller (new in 2023)
- 4 element Mosley Classic triband (10, 15, 20m + WARC bands - 12 and 17m) Yagi (on 80 foot tower) (new in 2023)
    - Yaesu rotator (new in 2023)
    - Green Heron rotator controller (new in 2023)
    
### 40 m

- ~~Dipole (on 100 foot tower )~~
  - Current out of service.
- Dipole (on 80 foot tower)

::: {.callout-note}

The 40m dipole on the 100 foot tower has been replaced with a 20m dipole.
A replacement 40m/80m fan dipole has been ordered.
We hope to install the dipole soon.

:::

### 80m

- Dipole, CW cut, on 60 foot tower.
- Dipole, Phone (75m) on other 60 foot tower.

### 160m

- Dipole on 80' north tower.

::: {.callout-note}

The 160m dipole is out of service.
A replacement has been acquired.
The club hopes to install the replacement in Fall 2023.

:::

### VHF/UHF

- The club has acquired a 6m yagi for future installation on the 100 foot tower.
- The K3YV UHF repeater has its transmit and receive antenna on the 60 foot tower.
- The club does not have resonant antennas for 30 or 60m.

## Future plans

- The club has plans to replace some of our 40m and 80m single band dipoles with 40m/80m fan dipoles. Those antennas are on-hand, but have not yet been installed.
- The club has acquired a 6m Yagi. We plan to install that antenna on the 100 foot tower at a future date.
- There is a vertically polarized 2m Yagi on top of the 100 foot tower. The 6m antenna may replace the 2m antenna, or we may service or replace the 2m antenna.
- There has been some discussion about installing an HF receive antenna, and about building or installing antennas for 60m and 30m.

## Antenna use

- Confirm that it is impossible for your transceiver to transmit while you are connecting your transceiver's (color-tagged) feedline to one of the antenna connectors.
- Switch antennas manually by connecting your radio feedline from array of antenna connectors on the north wall.
- When you leave the shack, disconnect the transceiver feedline from the antenna you were using.
