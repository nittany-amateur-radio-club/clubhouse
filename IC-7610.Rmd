### Connect equipment and power-up

- The IC-7610/NARC1 is located closest to the main door off the porch.

1. Connect to the power mains.
    - Power cables are located between the wooden shelf and the east wall.
    - Plug the large 240 V cable (green tag) for the amplifier power supply into the 240 V wall outlet.
    - Plug the smaller 120 V cable for the Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) into the 120 V wall outlet.
    
2. Connect the radio to a suitable antenna.

**Before you power up the radio, connect it to a suitable antenna**.
**The antenna connections are located on the north wall, near the repeater cabinet**.
Choose the PL-259 connector with the <span color="yellow">yellow</span> IC-7610 tag.
Plug the cable from the radio into the cable connector for one of the antennas, for example, one of the triband Yagis for 10-20 m.
**Please do not remove the N/PL-259 connectors from the antenna feedlines.**
    
3. Power up the UPS by pushing the front button. The green power light should illuminate.

4. Power up the Astron RS-35A power supply that powers the IC-7610/NARC1. The power supply is located to the right of the Elecraft KPA1500 amplifier.

5. Power up the IC-7610/NARC1 by pressing and briefly holding the power button.

6. Power up the Elecraft KPA1500 amplifier

The IC-7610/NARC1 is connected to the Elecraft KPA1500 amplifier. 
The power supply for the KPA1500 is under the desk on a small footstool. 
Check that the KPA1500 power supply is on. 
If necessary, power-up the power supply by hitting the power switch on the upper rear left side of the power supply. When the amplifier power switch is on, you will see 3 green lights: AC on, High V supply, Low V supply.
Power up the KPA1500 by pressing the `on` switch on the lower right hand side of the KPA1500 front panel.
